Final project in the computer major:
# Cake Shop Management System

This project is a simple cake shop management system that allows users to browse and order cakes and sweet packages, and also provides an admin interface to manage the application.

## Project Overview

The system is divided into two separate applications:

1. **Admin Application**: For managing the cake shop's catalog, processing orders, and overseeing the business.
2. **User Application**: For browsing cakes and sweet packages, making orders, and tracking order status.

The system allows the admin to add, edit, or remove cakes and sweet packages from the catalog, while users can view the catalog, place orders, and interact with the shop.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for the development of both applications.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: Used for building the user interface (UI) of both the admin and user applications.
